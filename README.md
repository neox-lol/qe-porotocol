## How it works in $QEProtocol?

1. We have 10K $QE721 NFT in total for our platform, project owner can buy the $QE721 NFT, then they can use it to init their $QE1155 project.
2. Every $QE1155 project contain `10K NFT` or `10K * ftSwapUnit $FT`, it means 1 NFT can swap with`ftSwapUnit $FT`.
3. It mixed ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC1155 implementation designed to provide a liquidity for every NFT project.

## The $QEProtocol components

### $QE20

The first Smart Inscription on X Chain. It's the functional token for $QEProtocol. Required in various situations. No investment value!

### $QE721

10K Total Supply, The owner of the $QE721 got a lot of benefit for long run, eg: QE Sell Income, platform Trading fee sharing.

### $QE1155

$QE721 can start QE via sold $QE1155 which has the duality of NFT and FT. User can swap 10K FT to get 1 NFT, or swap 1 NFT to get 10K FT.
Launchpad $QE1155 new project launch here, It's the feed stream for QE events, providing a platform for users to discover high-quality $QE721 projects.

## Grid

All 10K $QE721 NFT list on the grid that provides a visual map for our users, it can provide a farm function to generate profit from traffic.

## UI/UX

The project provides a beautiful and concise user UI/UX, and the $QEProtocol supported behind it makes this beautifully introduced interface have a truly valuable function: the FT/NFT project token Launchpad

## Features

$QEProtocol helps old NFT projects reactivate their liquidity (of course, new projects can also be launched directly on it).
Its unique FT/NFT duality will be extremely attractive to value projects, helping project parties better distribute their tokens/NFT while providing better liquidity to their users.
